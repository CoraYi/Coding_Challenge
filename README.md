# Up_down_counter

This is the source code for coding challenge submitted by Yuqi Yi. The design is a 4-bit synchronous up/down counter, with enable, asynchronous reset, and synchronous load. Additionally, a selecting signal is applied to conduct up counting or down counting. In the testbench, the function of each control signal is tested and loaded inputs are randomly assigned.
